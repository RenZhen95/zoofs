``ZooFS`` is a Python library for performing feature selection using an array of nature inspired wrapper algorithms. The algorithms range from swarm-intelligence to physics based to Evolutionary. 
It's easy to use ,flexible and powerful tool to reduce your feature size.  

## Installation

### Using pip

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install model-loger.

```python
from modellogger.modellogger import ModelLogger
```
## Usage
Define your own objective function for optimization !
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
def score_model(model,X_train, y_train, X_valid, y_valid):      
    model.fit(X_train,y_train)  
    P=log_loss(y_valid,model.predict_proba(X_valid))
    return P
    
# import an algorithm !  
from zoofs import ParticleSwarmOptimization
# define object of algorithm
algo_object=ParticleSwarmOptimization(score_model,n_iteration=20,population_size=20,minimize=True) 
# fit the algorithm
algo_object.fit(tryxg,X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test,verbose=True)
#plot your results
algo_object.plot_history()
   
```

``save_pickle`` : let's you save the model as a pickle file with model_name as the
file name . Uses joblib for pickling ,to use it later use joblib.load('name').

``model_name ``: Give a unique name to your model.

``columns`` :Columns used for tranning the model.

``accuracy`` : Scores to measure the performance eg. rmse , mse , logloss or a custom function that returns a metric.
           Ideally same factor across all models will help gaining insights from summary.

``Flag`` : If true than will print out the contents of the db.   

`model-logger` currently stores the following attribute:
